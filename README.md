# Smart Task Manager with AI Assistance for birthday celebration

This is a comprehensive task management application built with **Next.js 15+ (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It features intelligent **AI-powered subtask suggestions** using the **Google Gemini API**, robust **state management with Redux Toolkit**, and efficient data handling via **Next.js Server Actions**. This version also includes **client-side and server-side form validation** using Zod and React Hook Form, and **data revalidation** using Next.js caching mechanisms.

## üöÄ Features

* **Add, Edit, Delete Tasks:** Full CRUD operations for task management.
* **Task Fields:** Each task includes a Title, Description, Status (Pending/Completed), and an optional Due Date.
* **Mark as Complete:** Easily toggle the status of tasks.
* **AI-Powered Subtask Suggestions:** A "Suggest Subtasks (AI)" button on each task leverages the Google #Gemini AI to break down complex tasks into 3-5 smaller, actionable steps, enhancing productivity.
* **Centralized State Management:** Utilizes **Redux Toolkit** for a predictable, scalable, and maintainable client-side state. No `localStorage` is used for task data directly; Redux manages the client's view, which is synced with successful server action calls.
* **Server Actions:** All data mutations (adding, updating, deleting tasks, toggling status) and AI calls are performed using Next.js Server Actions, providing a streamlined and type-safe way to interact with server-side logic directly from client components.
* **Form Validation:**
    * **Client-side:** Implemented using **React Hook Form** with **ZodResolver** for immediate user feedback.
    * **Server-side:** Robust validation using **Zod** within Server Actions to ensure data integrity before persistence.
* **Data Revalidation:** Employs Next.js's `revalidatePath` in Server Actions to ensure that cached data is invalidated and the UI displays the most up-to-date information after mutations.
* **Performance Optimizations:** Implements React's `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks, along with `memo` for components, to minimize unnecessary component re-renders and re-computations, leading to a smoother user experience.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure a clean and functional interface that adapts well to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
